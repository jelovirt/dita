  <shortdesc id="shortdesc">A DITA map is the mechanism for aggregating topic references and
    defining a context for those references. It contains references to topics, maps, and other
    resources; these references are organized into hierarchies, groups, and tables.</shortdesc>

        <p>A map describes the relationships among a set of DITA topics. The following are types of
          relationships that can be described in a map:</p>

          <dlentry>
            <dt>Hierarchical</dt>
            <dd>Nested topics create a hierarchical relationship. The topic that does the nesting is
              the parent, and the topics that are nested are the children.</dd>
          </dlentry>
          <dlentry>
            <dt>Ordered</dt>
            <dd>Child topics can be labeled as having an ordered relationship, which means they are
              referenced in a definite sequence.</dd>

          <dlentry>
            <dt>Family</dt>
            <dd>Child topics can be labeled as having a family relationship, which means they all
              refer to each other.</dd>

      <p>When rendering a map, processors might make use of the relationships defined in the map to
        create a Table of Contents (TOC), aggregate topics into a PDF document, or create links
        between topics in the output.</p>
      <p platform="dita">The <xmlelement>title</xmlelement> element can be used to provide a title
        for the map. In some scenarios the title is purely informational; it is present only as an
        aid to the author. In other scenarios, the title might be useful or even required. In a map
        referenced by another map, the title might be discarded as topics from the submap are
        aggregated into a larger publication.</p>

              the map with <xmlatt>anchorref</xmlatt> to be pulled into the location of the anchor
              point "a1" inside <filepath>map1.ditamap</filepath> when
