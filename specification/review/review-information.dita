        <p>Here are some general guidelines:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Review the content as distributed in PDF format, and then enter your comments in
                DITAweb at <xref href="https://ditaweb.com/oasis-dita/" format="html"
                    scope="external"/>. DITAweb can introduce some formatting inconsistencies, so
                ensure that any formatting errors – such as extra spaces – are present in the PDF
                before commenting in DITAweb.</li>
            <li>For early targeted reviews, the attributes topics are not included in the review,
                although cross references to them are rendered in the PDF output. If the attributes
                topics are available in DITAweb, do not comment on them.</li>
            <li>The DITA Technical Committee uses the <xref
