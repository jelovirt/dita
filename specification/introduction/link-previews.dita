    <shortdesc>The DITA specification uses the content of the DITA
            <xmlelement>shortdesc</xmlelement> element to provide link previews for its readers.
        These link previews are visually highlighted by a border and a colored
        background.</shortdesc>

        <p>The link previews serve as enhanced navigation aids, enabling readers to more easily
            locate content. This usability enhancement is one of the ways in which the specification
            illustrates the capabilities of DITA and exemplifies DITA best practices. </p>
        <p>The following screen capture illustrates how link previews are displayed in the HTML5
            version of the specification: </p>
