<title>Examples of the <xmlatt>chunk</xmlatt> attribute</title>
<shortdesc>These examples illustrate the processing expectations for various scenarios that involve
        the <xmlatt>chunk</xmlatt> attribute. The processing examples use either before and after
        sample markup or expanded syntax that shows the equivalent markup without the
            <xmlatt>chunk</xmlatt> attribute.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
<note>Examples use sample files with modified file names to help illustrate equivalent before and
after resolution of <xmlatt>chunk</xmlatt> attributes. However, there is no requirement for
implementations processing <xmlatt>chunk</xmlatt> to generate files, as long as the rendered result
is split or combined as described. If generating files, actual file names are implementation
dependent.</note>
