   <p>Comment by Eliot Kimber:</p>
   <p>I think we need a general discussion of index processing and rendering that covers:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Generation of page numbers or other locators (addresses "typical" question)</li>
    <li>General rules or expectations for merging entries to produce the "effective index
     markup"</li>
    <li>General guidance for reporting conditions such as see-also references to non-existent
     entries and missing @end for @start specified in maps.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The current writeup reflects a lot of unstated assumptions about how index processing does or
    should work, obviously reflecting how IBM's tools worked (and work today). These assumptions
    need to be surfaced.</p>

   <p>We need to clearly state our assumptions, but I think we need to be careful about specifying
    expected processing too precisely:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>We have no idea what output format people are transforming their DITA to; we cannot assume
     that it is print-based. And we have no idea what sort of output formats might emerge after DITA
     2.0 is released!</li>
    <li>Not all DITA processors support indexing.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>It would be good to be upfront about the fact that many details about index generation will be
    implementation specific.</p>
