    <p>A specialized attribute has the following characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is specialized from <xmlatt>props</xmlatt> or <xmlatt>base</xmlatt>.</li>
      <li rev="2.0">It can be integrated into a document-type shell either globally, which makes it
        available on all elements, or it can be assigned to specific elements by using an expansion
        module.</li>
      <li>It does not have values or value ranges that are more extensive than those of the
        attribute from which it was specialized.</li>
      <li>Its values must be alphanumeric space-delimited values. In generalized form, the values
        must conform to the rules for attribute generalization.</li>
    </ul>
