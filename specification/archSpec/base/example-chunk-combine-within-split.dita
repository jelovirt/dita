<title>Example: Combining topics within a split context</title>
<shortdesc>While <xmlatt>chunk</xmlatt> attributes are ignored when a "combine" action is already in
effect, it is possible to use <codeph>chunk="combine"</codeph> when <codeph>split</codeph> is
otherwise in effect.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
<p>Assume the following map, where <codeph>chunk="split"</codeph> on the root element means that all
topic documents within this map structure are split by default, but a branch within the map sets
<codeph>chunk="combine"</codeph>.</p>
<fig id="fig_htr_jyd_1gb">
<title>Map with default "split" action, that also uses "combine"</title>
<codeblock>&lt;map chunk="split">
  &lt;title>Split most, but not one branch&lt;/title>
  &lt;topicref href="splitme.dita">...&lt;/topicref>
  &lt;topicref href="exception.dita" chunk="combine">...&lt;/topicref>
  &lt;topicref href="splitmetoo.dita">...&lt;/topicref>
&lt;/topicref></codeblock>
</fig>
<p>Assume as well that no other <xmlatt>chunk</xmlatt> attributes are specified in this map. The
following points are true when <xmlatt>chunk</xmlatt> is evaluated:<ol id="ol_p3y_wng_thb">
<li>The document <filepath>splitme.dita</filepath> is treated as multiple split documents when it
contains more than one topic. The same is true for any other document within that branch.</li>
<li>The second branch (beginning with <filepath>exception.dita</filepath>) is treated as a single
DITA document, combining all topic documents within that branch.</li>
<li>The document <filepath>splitmetoo.dita</filepath> is treated as multiple split documents when it
contains more than one topic. The same is true for any other document within that branch.</li>
