                        <p>I'm not sure I agree with this rule. If I start a range in one topic body
                            and end it in another topic body and the two topics are presented in a
                            sequence such that the second topic follows the first I would expect the
                            range to span from the first topic to the second.</p>
                        <p>So the rule is at least dependent on the presentation context--in a
                            continuous presentation there's no reason to impose boundaries, but in a
                            chunked presentation there might be.</p>
                        <p>I think there's an unstated assumption that indexes are rendered for
                            paged media where page numbers make sense but that's not a necessary
                            condition--for example, I could have chunked HTML output that includes
                            knowledge of the page numbers the content is rendered on in some other
                            paged rendering (i.e., the printed version of municipal code, where the
                            page numbers are captured in an element-to-page-number mapping and the
                            HTML rendering of the same content, where the page numbers are included
                            as literal or meta data in the HTML pages). </p>

                        <p>Comment updated on 19 August 2019:</p>
                        <p>FYI, these rules have been in the DITA spec since DITA 1.1, when the
                                <xmlatt>start</xmlatt> and <xmlatt>end</xmlatt> attributes were
                            added to <xmlelement>indexterm</xmlelement>.</p>
                        <p>Hopefully all references to "page numbers" have been changed to the more
                            neutral term "locator".</p>
                        <p>Eliot, I think that for your use case, the appropriate markup would be to
                            index in the map. Per the processing outlined in this draft, the range
                            should begin at the start of one topic and end at the end of the other
                            topic.</p>
                        <!--<p>If an <xmlelement>indexterm</xmlelement> element in a map is a point reference to the start of the <xmlelement>title</xmlelement> element, what does an <xmlelement>indexterm</xmlelement> with an <xmlatt>end</xmlatt> attribute point to? Also the start of the <xmlelement>title</xmlelement> element in the topic?</p>-->
                        <p>For example, given the following map, the generated index entry should be
                            "test, x- y", where x = the title of
                                <filepath>index-page-references.dita</filepath> and y = the end of
                                <filepath>merging-index-elements.dita</filepath>. </p>
