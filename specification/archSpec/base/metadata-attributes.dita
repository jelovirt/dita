 <title>Metadata attributes</title>
  <shortdesc>The metadata attributes specify properties of the content that can be used to determine
    how the content is processed. Specialized metadata attributes can be defined to enable specific
    business-processing needs, such as semantic processing and data mining.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>Metadata attributes typically are used for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Filtering content based on the attribute values, for example, to suppress or publish
        profiled content</li>
      <li>Flagging content based on the attribute values, for example, to highlight specific content
        on output</li>
      <li>Performing custom processing, for example, to extract business-critical data and store it
        in a database</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Typically <xmlatt>audience</xmlatt>, <xmlatt>platform</xmlatt>, <xmlatt>product</xmlatt>,
        <xmlatt>otherprops</xmlatt>, <xmlatt>props</xmlatt>, <xmlatt>deliveryTarget</xmlatt>, and
      specializations of the <xmlatt>props</xmlatt> attributes are used for filtering; the same
      attributes plus the <xmlatt>rev</xmlatt> attribute are used for flagging. The
        <xmlatt>status</xmlatt> and <xmlatt>importance</xmlatt> attributes, as well as custom
      attributes specialized from <xmlatt>base</xmlatt>, are used for application-specific behavior,
      such as identifying metadata to aid in search and retrieval.</p>
