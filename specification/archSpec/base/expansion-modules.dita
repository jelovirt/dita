    <title>Expansion modules</title>
    <shortdesc>Expansion modules enable the extension of content models and attribute lists for
        individual elements. Expansion modules are the opposite of constraints; they add elements
        and attributes to specific content models and attribute lists, rather than removing
        them.</shortdesc>
