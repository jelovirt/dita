                <dd>Normative information is the formal portion of the specification that describes
                    the rules and requirements that make up the DITA standard and which must be
                    followed.</dd>

                <dt>Non-normative information</dt>
                <dd>Non-normative information includes descriptions that provide background,
                    examples, notes, and other useful information that are not formal requirements
                    or rules that must be followed.</dd>
            </dlentry>
        </dl>
        <p>All information in the specification is normative unless it is an example, a note, an
            appendix, or is explicitly labeled as non-normative.</p>
        <p>The DITA specification contains examples to help clarify or illustrate specific aspects
            of the specification. Because examples are specific rather than general, they might not
            illustrate all aspects or be the only way to accomplish or implement an aspect of the
            specification. Therefore all examples are non-normative.</p>
