  <title>Element generalization</title>
  <shortdesc>Elements are generalized by examining the <xmlatt>class</xmlatt> attribute. When a
    generalization process detects that an element belongs to one of the modules that is being
    generalized, the element is renamed to a more general form.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p otherprops="examples">For example, the <xmlelement>step</xmlelement> element has a
        <xmlatt>class</xmlatt> attribute value of <codeph>"- topic/li task/step "</codeph>. If the
      task module is being generalized, the <xmlelement>step</xmlelement> element is renamed to its
      more general form from the topic module: <xmlelement>li</xmlelement>.</p>
    <p >For specific concerns when generalizing structural types with
      dependencies on non-ancestor modules, see <xref
        href="generalization-w-cross-specialization-dependencies.dita"/>.</p>
    <p>While the tag name of a given element is normally the same as the type name of the last token
      in the <xmlatt>class</xmlatt> value, this is not required. <ph otherprops="examples">For
        example, if a generalization process has already run on the element, the
          <xmlatt>class</xmlatt> attribute could contain tokens from two or more modules based on
        the original specialization. In that case, the element name could already match the first
        token or an intermediate token in the <xmlatt>class</xmlatt> attribute. A second
        generalization process could end up renaming the element again or could leave it alone,
        depending on the target module or document type.</ph></p>
