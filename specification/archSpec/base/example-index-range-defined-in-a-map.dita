    <title>Example: Index range defined in a map</title>
    <shortdesc>In this scenario, an index range is defined in the DITA map. Ranges defined in a DITA
        map can span peer topics.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Consider the following DITA map:</p>
        <codeblock>&lt;map>
  &lt;title>Food available in the Acme cafeteria&lt;/title>
  &lt;!-- ... -->
  &lt;topicref href="apples.dita">
    &lt;topicmeta>
      &lt;keywords>
        &lt;indexterm start="acme-fruit">fruit&lt;/indexterm>
      &lt;/keywords>
    &lt;/topicmeta>
  &lt;/topicref>
  &lt;topicref href="oranges.dita"/>
  &lt;topicref href="pineapples.dita">
    &lt;topicmeta>
      &lt;keywords>
        &lt;indexterm start="acme-fruit"/>
      &lt;/keywords>
    &lt;/topicmeta>
  &lt;/topicref>
  &lt;!-- ... -->
&lt;/map></codeblock>
        <p>The index range begins with the start of the first topic title in
                <filepath>apples.dita</filepath>, and it continues until the end of the last element
            in <filepath>pineapples.dita</filepath>. If an end element was not specified, the range
            would continue to the end of the map.</p>
    <draft-comment author="Eliot Kimber" time="09 August 2019">I think this should be a reportable
      error or warning since it's almost certainly not the author's intent for a range to span to
      the end of the publication.</draft-comment>
    <draft-comment author="Kristen J Eberlein" time="13 August 2019">
      <p>Eliot, I disagree. If the map is a submap that is consumed by a larger publication (for
        example, a map of examples of using keys), I think the default range boundary of "end of the
        map" might be entirely appropriate.</p>
      <!--<p>Also, this is example is stating behavior about ranges defined in maps that we do not lay out in <xref href="index-ranges.dita"/> â€“ in particular, that the presence of an end element in a map signifies that the end-of-the-range is the <b>end</b> of the topic that contains the end element. This makes good sense to me, but it conflicts with the usual expectation that an <xmlelement>indexterm</xmlelement> element in a map (or prolog) is a point reference to the start of the topic title.</p>-->
