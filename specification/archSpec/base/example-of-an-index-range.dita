    <title>Example: Index ranges</title>
    <shortdesc>There are three locations that can declare a index range: the body of a topic, the
    prolog of a topic, and a map.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
    <section>
      <title>Index range that starts within a topic prolog</title>
    </section>
    <section id="index-range-in-map">
      <title>Index range specified within a map</title>
      <p>In the final code sample, the index range is specified in a map.</p>
      <codeblock>&lt;topicref href="acct.dita">
  &lt;topicmeta>
    &lt;keywords>
      &lt;indexterm start="acct">accounting&lt;/indexterm>
      &lt;indexterm end="acct"/>
      &lt;indexterm start="govt">government forms&lt;/indexterm>
    &lt;/keywords>
  &lt;/topicmeta>
  &lt;!-- Nested topicref elements -->
&lt;/topicref>
&lt;topicref href="taxfiling.dita">
  &lt;topicmeta>
    &lt;keywords>
      &lt;indexterm end="govt"/>
    &lt;/keywords>
  &lt;/topicmeta>
&lt;/topicref></codeblock>
      <p>The index range for "accounting" begins with the start of the first topic title in
          <filepath>acct.dita</filepath>; it includes that topic as well as any subtopics. </p>
      <p>The index range for "government forms" begins with the start of the first topic title in
          <filepath>acct.dita</filepath>, and continues until the end of the last element in the
        file <filepath>taxfiling.dita</filepath>. If the end range for "govt" was not specified, the
        range would continue to the end of the map.</p>
      <draft-comment author="Eliot Kimber" time="09 August 2019">I think this should be a reportable
        error or warning since it's almost certainly not the author's intent for a range to span to
        the end of the publication.</draft-comment>
      <draft-comment author="Kristen J Eberlein" time="13 August 2019">
        <p>Eliot, I disagree. If the map is a submap that is consumed by a larger publication (for
          example, a map of examples of using keys), I think the default range boundary of "end of
          the map" might be entirely appropriate.</p>
        <p>Also, this is example is stating behavior about ranges defined in maps that we do not lay
          out in <xref href="index-ranges.dita"/> â€“ in particular, that the presence of an end
          element in a map signifies that the end-of-the-range is the <b>end</b> of the topic that
          contains the end element. This makes good sense to me, but it conflicts with the usual
          expectation that an <xmlelement>indexterm</xmlelement> element in a map (or prolog) is a
          point reference to the start of the topic title.</p>
