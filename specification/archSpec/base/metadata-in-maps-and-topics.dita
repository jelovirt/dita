  <shortdesc>Information about topics can be specified as metadata on the map, as attributes on the
<xmlelement>topicref</xmlelement> element, or as metadata attributes or elements in the topic
itself. By default, metadata in the map supplements or overrides metadata that is specified at the
topic level.</shortdesc><conbody>

        <dd>
          <p>At the map level, properties can be set by using metadata elements. They can be set for
            an individual topic, for a set of topics, or globally for the entire document. The
            metadata elements are authored within a <xmlelement>topicmeta</xmlelement> element,
            which associates metadata with the parent element and its children. Because the topics
            in a branch of the hierarchy typically have some common subjects or properties, this is
            a convenient mechanism to define properties for a set of topics. For example, the
              <xmlelement>topicmeta</xmlelement> element in a <xmlelement>relcolspec</xmlelement>
            can associate metadata with all the topics that are referenced in the
              <xmlelement>reltable</xmlelement> column.</p>
          <p>A map can override or supplement everything about a topic except its primary title and
            body content. All the metadata elements that are available in a topic also are available
            in a map. In addition, a map can use <xmlatt>copy-to</xmlatt> provide alternate titles
            and a short description. The alternate titles can override their equivalent titles in
            the topic. </p>

      <dlentry>
        <dt>DITA map: Attributes of the <xmlelement>topicref</xmlelement> element</dt>
        <dd>At the map level, properties can be set as attributes of the
            <xmlelement>topicref</xmlelement> element. </dd>
      </dlentry>
      <dlentry>
        <dt>DITA topic</dt>
        <dd>Within a topic, authors can either set metadata attributes on the root element or add
          metadata elements in the <xmlelement>prolog</xmlelement> element.</dd>
      </dlentry>
    </dl>
    <p> When the same metadata element or attribute is specified in both a map and a topic, by
default the value in the map takes precedence; the assumption here is that the author of the map has
more knowledge of the reusing context than the author of the topic.</p>
    <p>The <xmlelement>navtitle</xmlelement> element is an exception to the rule of how metadata
      specified by the <xmlelement>topicmeta</xmlelement> element cascades. The content of the
        <xmlelement>navtitle</xmlelement> element is used as a navigation title only if the
        <xmlatt>locktitle</xmlatt> attribute of the parent <xmlelement>topicref</xmlelement> element
      is set to "yes".</p>
