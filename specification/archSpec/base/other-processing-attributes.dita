                <dd>A generic attribute that has no specific purpose, but is intended to act as the
                    basis for specialized attributes that have a simple value syntax like the
                    conditional processing attributes (one or more alphanumeric values separated by
                    whitespace or parenthesized groups of values).</dd>

                <dd>Provides a label on one or more element instances, typically to specify a role
                    or other semantic distinction. As the <xmlatt>outputclass</xmlatt> attribute
                    does not provide a formal type declaration or the structural consistency of
                    specialization, use it sparingly, usually only as a temporary measure while a
                    specialization is developed. For example, <xmlelement>uicontrol</xmlelement>
                    elements that define button labels could be distinguished by adding an
                        <xmlatt>outputclass</xmlatt> attribute:
                    <codeblock>&lt;uicontrol outputclass="button">Cancel&lt;/uicontrol></codeblock>The
                    value of the <xmlatt>outputclass</xmlatt> attribute can be used to trigger XSLT
                    or CSS rules, while providing a mapping to be used for future migration to a
                    more specialized set of user interface elements.</dd>
